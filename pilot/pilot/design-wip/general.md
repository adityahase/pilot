Single Global Control Plane

e.g. 
- AWS Dashboard
- DO Dashboard

For handling Auth / Teams / Billing Centrally

### Regions
#### Authority Region
There's still single Primary
Maybe Control Plane resides here

#### Isolated
No shared fault domain
Failures don't impact each other

#### Autonomous ?!?


#### Minimal Communication
Data usually doesn't leave the Region.
Public Internet is slow and Expensive
